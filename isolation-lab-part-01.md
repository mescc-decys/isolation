# Introduction

This short project is divided into three parts. In each part, you will experiment with various aspects of software Isolation using Docker, a popular platform for packaging applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, each in its own isolated environment[^P11]. 

Each of the different parts are intended to be roughly a practical (PL) class, but your mileage may vary; feel free to do it at your own pace, but don’t forget to be thorough on your observations and report. Each part has a setup section indicating what you will need to perform the short project.

Submit a report that describes the procedures you followed. Please explain noteworthy or unexpected observations. Don’t forget to address all the questions (in bold) in this short project description. Provide details on how you arrived at the conclusions/results (do not just paste the result). The report can be developed in a team of up to 4 members (exceptions must be approved). See the report submission dates in Moodle.

## Criteria

The Short Project will be graded using the following rubric. Please use this detailed rubric as guidance to create a good, detailed report. If the assignment is deemed unacceptable in a given criterion, a 0 will be given to that respective criterion.

# Part 1: Keeping Secrets OUT of Docker Images

Researchers[^P12] have found that many publicly available Docker images contain secrets, such as private keys, API keys and more. Let’s start by spending about 10-15 minutes having a look at the research paper. You only need to get a brief overview of it.

## Setup

For this part of the short project, you will need a computer with Docker installed. Other tools you might need (like a way to unpack tar files), should be available in most OSes.

## Start: Noob Mistake

Someone at Insecure LabsTM thought it was a good idea to ask Scott, the intern, to create the container for their latest product (a javascript application running on Node.js). He followed the [Docker getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/02_our_app/) and adopted a similar Dockerfile:

```
FROM  node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app  
COPY . .  
RUN yarn install  --production  
CMD  ["node", "src/index.js"]  EXPOSE 3000  
```

The application uses some credentials at runtime and creates an encrypted secure storage for them. However, during “yarn install”, it needs to have the following .env file (don’t question these design decisions, Tom’s a [super-genious](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-inner-json-effect?ref=gorillasun.de)!): 

```
API_KEY=<some  secret api key>  
USER=<some  secret user>  
```

This is how the folder of the application looks like when Scott builds the container:

```
├── insecure-labs/
│ ├── .env
│ ├── package.json
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── src/
│ └── yarn.lock
```

The image is publicly available in Docker Hub:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/isepdei/insecurelabs01

**Question** **1.** **What is the issue here?**

**Question** **2.** **Can you recover the actual secrets from the image? Describe how you would do this and include a screenshot of the recovered secrets.**

## Fixed it!

Tom, the senior engineer, quickly spotted Scott’s mistake: “Let me fix that for you!”. Here is the Dockerfile Tom wrote:

```
FROM  node:18-alpine  
WORKDIR /app  
COPY . .  
RUN yarn install  --production  
RUN rm .env # .env  only needed during yarn install
CMD  ["node", "src/index.js"]  EXPOSE 3000  
```

Scott created a new API key and invalidated the old one. The resulting image is publicly available in Docker Hub:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/isepdei/insecurelabs02

**Question** **3.** **What do you think of Tom’s fix?**

**Question** **4.** **Is it possible to recover the new API key now[^P13] ? Provide detailed instructions and include a screenshot of the recovered API key.**


**Question** **5.** **So, how would you go about doing Scott’s job? Would you do something different? Explain in detail.**
